#+TITLE: Hello, World!\n
* Level 1 Heading
  This file contains a small amount of text to demonstrate the org
  publishing workflow.

  [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/will08rien/org-publishing/main/001--hello-world.org][As you can see]], there is nothing special about this file. Running it
  through the generator command should yield a pdf that looks like
  pretty standard \LaTeX{} output.

** Level 2 Heading
   The org headings translate to section titles within the output, thus
   the already super-convenient authoring system available in Org allows
   you to easily construct simple documents for redistribution without
   fuss.

** Generating PDF
   As per the instructions in the top level README, this file can be
   used to generate a PDF through the Org export mechanism. For
   simplicity, a docker image is provided to enable an initial
   playground and can be used in the following way with this file:
   #+begin_src shell
  docker run --rm -v $PWD:/org w08r/org-publishing:0.0.1 \
   emacs --batch --eval '
     (progn
       (find-file "/org/001--hello-world.org")
       (org-latex-export-to-pdf))'
   #+end_src
