#+title: Org Publishing

This repository contains my opinionated look at how to produce
beautiful technical publications using the suite of tools that
surround the Emacs package, Org mode[fn:1].

Each page in the guide is a self-executing `.org` file that can be
"weaved" to produce pdf output. The execution environment is described
by the Dockerfile which can be found at the top level of this
repository: `dockerfile.XXX`. The associated image is built and can be
obtained from docker hub.

For example, to run the hello world org file, run the following:

#+begin_src shell
  docker run --rm -v $PWD:/org w08r/org-publishing:0.0.2 \
         emacs --batch --eval '
       progn
         (find-file "/org/001--hello-world.org")
         (org-latex-export-to-pdf)'
#+end_src

The first 3 parts cover a 90mph overview of the features that will
help to produce high quality *reproducible* output. The parts
following will then provide a deep dive into some of the patterns used
earlier and into Org mode workflow in general.
