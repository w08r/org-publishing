#+title: Org Publishing

This repo contains my opinionated look at how to produce beautiful
technical publications using the suite of tools that surround the
Emacs package, Org mode[fn:1].

Each section in the guide is a self-executing `.org` file that can be
executed to produce pdf output. The execution environment is described
by the Dockerfile which can be found at the top level of this
repository: `dockerfile.XXX`. The associated image is built and can be
obtained from docker hub.

For example, to run the hello world org file, run the following:

#+begin_src shell
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/org w08r/org-publishing:0.0.1 \
   emacs --batch --eval '
     (progn
       (find-file "/org/001--hello-world.org")
       (org-latex-export-to-pdf))'
#+end_src

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Org mode is for keeping notes, maintaining to-do lists, planning projects, authoring documents, computational notebooks, literate programming and more â€” in a fast and effective plain text system. https://orgmode.org/
